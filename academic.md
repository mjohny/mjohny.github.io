### Academic/Research 

I have a Master's degree in Statistics from Iowa State University, and a Bachelor's degree from Saint Louis University where I double majored in Chemistry and Mathematics. Currently, I'm a Ph.D student at Iowa State, where I'm working with Dr. Petruta Caragea on extending functional anova methodology. 

My Master's research focused on using a functional anova approach to detect significant differences between groups of time series curves, which was ultimately applied to test for significant differences in soil moisture and temperature due to simulated climate change. In my Ph.D dissertation research, I have been working on extending functional anova methodology to test for interaction between treatment groups, and developing novel visualizations of statistical significance. My research interests are motivated by scientific problems and a desire to apply statistics to better understand scientific phenomena. 

Besides research and classes, I'm also an instructor for Stat 101 at ISU. If interested, you can check out some of my projects and teaching materials on my [github page](https://github.com/mjohny)!
