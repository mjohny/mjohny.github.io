### Personal

I was born in Kerala, India (Kerala is a small state in southern India known for its backwaters and beautiful green landscape -- [some](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjohny/mjohny.github.io/master/img/big-imgs/india/P1000121.jpg) [pictures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjohny/mjohny.github.io/master/img/big-imgs/india/P1000203.jpg) [from](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjohny/mjohny.github.io/master/img/big-imgs/india/P1000101.jpg) [a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjohny/mjohny.github.io/master/img/big-imgs/india/P1000559.jpg) [trip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjohny/mjohny.github.io/master/img/big-imgs/india/P1000269.jpg)). When I was 8, I moved to St. Louis, Missouri with my family. During my highschool and undergraduate years in St. Louis, I developed a passion for mathematics and science. This eventually led me to Ames, Iowa to pursue this passion in my graduate studies!

In our free time, some friends at Iowa State and I competed in the [2016 Prudsys Data Mining Cup](https://www.data-mining-cup.com/reviews/dmc-2016/). We had a lot of fun in the competition while learning a lot about machine learning and data mining in the process. We ended up placing second in the international competition and traveling to Berlin, Germany to present our solution!
