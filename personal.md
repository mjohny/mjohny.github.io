### Personal

I was born in Kerala, India (Kerala is a small state in southern India known for its backwaters and beautiful green landscape). When I was 8, I moved to St. Louis, Missouri with my family. During my highschool and undergraduate years in St. Louis, I developed a passion for mathematics and science. This eventually led me to move to Ames, Iowa to follow this passion in my graduate studies!

In our free time, some friend at Iowa State and I competed in the 2016 Prudsys Data Mining Competition. This led us to learn a lot about machine learning and data mining in the process, and we ended up placing second in the international competition and traveling to Berlin, Germany to present our solution! Recently, I've developed a new found interest in Raspberry pi, and am working on building a temperature sensor that will allow me to check if my stove is on/off/warming/cooing remotely from my phone as a side project! So far, it's been really fun learning about breadboards, building circuits, and using python!
