### Welcome to my website!  

Hello, my name is Manju and I'm a Ph.D student in Statistics at Iowa State University. Have a look around my website where I've written a little bit about myself, organized some of my past projects, and posted my [CV](https://mjohny.github.io/files/mjohny_cv.pdf). 

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:manjujohny@gmail.com">email</a>. Thanks for stopping by, and have a great day!
