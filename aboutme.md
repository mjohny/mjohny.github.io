### Academic & Professional

I am a third year Ph.D student in Statistics at Iowa State University. Before coming to ISU, I recieved a Bachelor's from Saint Louis Univesity where I double majored in Mathematics and Chemistry. My research interests are motivated by scientific problems and a desire to apply statistics to better understand scientific phenomena. Right now, I'm working on my Master's thesis. In it, I apply an assymptoptic anova for functional data in the context of an ecological study. Besides research and classes, I'm also an instructor for Stat 101 at ISU. If interested, you can check out some of my projects and teaching materials on my github page!  

### Personal

I was born in Kerala, India (Kerala is a southern state in India known for its backwaters and beautiful green landscape). When I was 7, I moved to St. Louis, Missouri with my family. Having experienced a blend of cultures at a young age, I'm interested in learning about different cultures and love trying new food!
