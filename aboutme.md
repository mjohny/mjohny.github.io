### Academic/Research 

I have a Master's degree in Statistics from Iowa State University, and Bachelor's degree from Saint Louis University where I double majored in Chemistry and Mathematics. Currently, I'm a Ph.D student at Iowa State.

My Master's research focused on using a functional anova approach to detect significant differences between groups of time series curves, which was ultimately applied to test for significant differences in soil moisture and temperature due to simulated climate change. In my Ph.D dissertation research, I have been working with Dr. Petruta Caragea in extending functional anova methodology to test for interaction between treatment groups, and develop novel visualizations of statistical significance. My research interests are motivated by scientific problems and a desire to apply statistics to better understand scientific phenomena. 

Besides research and classes, I'm also an instructor for Stat 101 at ISU. If interested, you can check out some of my projects and teaching materials on my github page!  

### Personal

I was born in Kerala, India (Kerala is a small state in southern India known for its backwaters and beautiful green landscape). When I was 8, I moved to St. Louis, Missouri with my family. During my highschool and undergraduate years in St. Louis, I developed a passion for mathematics and science. This eventually led me to move to Ames, Iowa to follow this passion in my graduate studies!

In our free time, some friend at Iowa State and I competed in the 2016 Prudsys Data Mining Competition. This led us to learn a lot about machine learning and data mining in the process, and we ended up placing second in the international competition and traveling to Berlin, Germany to present our solution! Recently, I've developed a new found interest in Raspberry pi, and am working on building a temperature sensor that will allow me to check if my stove is on/off/warming/cooing remotely from my phone as a side project! So far, it's been really fun learning about breadboards, building circuits, and using python!
