I am currently a graduate student at Iowa State University pursuing a Ph.D in Statistics. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in 2014 from Saint Louis University, where I double majored in Mathematics and Chemistry. My research is motivated by the scientific problems. Besides research and classes, I am an instructor for Stat 101 at ISU.

I am a third year Ph.D student in Statistics at Iowa State University. Before coming to ISU, I recieved a Bachelor's from Saint Louis Univesity where I double majored in Mathematics and Chemistry. My research interests are motivated by scientific problems and a desire to apply statistics to better understand scientific phenomena. Right now, I'm working on my Master's thesis. In it, I apply an assymptoptic anova for functional data in the context of an ecological study. Besides research and classes, I'm also an instructor for Stat 101 at ISU. If interested, you can check out some of my projects and teaching materials on my github page!
