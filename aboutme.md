I am currently a graduate student at Iowa State University pursuing a Ph.D in Statistics. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in 2014 from Saint Louis University, where I double majored in Mathematics and Chemistry. My research is motivated by the scientific problems. Besides research and classes, I am an instructor for Stat 101 at ISU.
