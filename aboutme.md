subtitle: Ph.D Student in Statistics 
---

I am third year Ph.D student in Statistics at Iowa State University. Before coming to ISU, I recieved a Bachelor of Arts from Saint Louis Univesity where I double majored in Mathematics and Chemistry. My research interests are motivated by scientific problems and a desire to apply statistics to better understand scientific phenomena. Right now, I'm working on my Master's thesis. In it, I apply an assymptoptic anova test for functional data in the context of an ecological study. Besides research and classes, I also enjoy being an instructor for Stat 101 at ISU!
